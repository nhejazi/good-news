Archer: (On crocodiles) "Gee, I don't know. Maybe deep down I'm afraid of any apex predator that lived through the K-T extinction.

Archer: "I’m not saying I invented the turtleneck, but I was the first person to realise its potential as a tactical garment. The tactical turtleneck! The...tactleneck."

Archer: "Karate? The Dane Cook of martial arts?! No. ISIS agents use Krav Maga."
Archer: "I've waited my entire life to say this exact phrase: 'I'm commandeering this airboat!'"
